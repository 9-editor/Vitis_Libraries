Vitis RTM Library
=====================

Reverse Time Migration (RTM) is an important seismic imaging technique used for producing an
accurate representation of the subsurface.
Vitis RTM Library provides an acceleration libray for explicit FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain)
solution, including basic functions (e.g. stencil) and prebuild kernels (e.g. rtmforward).
Two types of implementations are provided
in this library, namely L1 primitives and L2 kernels. These 
implementations are organized in their corresponding directories L1 and L2.
The L1 primitives' implementations can be leveraged by FPGA hardware developers.
The L2 kernels' implementations provide usage examples for Vitis kernel developers.

Since all the kernel code is developed with the permissive Apache 2.0 license,
advanced users can easily tailor, optimize or combine them for their own need.
Demos and usage examples of different levels' implementations are also provided
for reference.
