        - Algorithm is very sensitive to any zeros in the diagonals. Please be aware that zeros in diagonals could lead to division by zero and algorithm fails.
          
          Experiments have shown that the algorithm failes for number of steps greater than 8. In that case it is recommend limit numebr of steps to 8. The same idea is used in LOGN calculation in pentadiag_top.h file.
