Overview
========

The Galois/Counter (GCM) mode is a typical encryption and decryption mode using AES algorithm.
In this version, we provide AES-256 processing ability, which means the cipherkey in this design should be 256 bits.
Our working mode works on units of a fixed size (128 bits for 1 block), but text in the real world has a variety of lengths.
Therefore, the final block of the text must be padded to 128 bits before encryption or decryption.
Another limitation is that we utilize the simplest way as the IEEE standard mentioned to generate initial counter block (ICB), so the length of the initialization vector (IV) should be 96 bits.
For calculating the tag, the additional authenticated data (AAD) is restricted to 128 bits in this design.
If you don’t have an AAD (as in much applications), you should set the AAD to zero.

Implementation on FPGA
======================

We support GCM mode including both encryption and decryption parts in this implementation.
Notice that the plaintext, ciphertext, and AAD should be 128 bits. The IV should be 96 bits.
To give a similar interface as the encryption part, we provide the tag value instead of a FAIL flag in the decryption part.
Thus, you need to compare it with the tag which is generated by the GCM encryption part to judge whether the data is authentic or not.
The algorithm flow chart of encryption part of GCM mode is shown as follow:

As we can see from the chart, the GCM encryption part can be divided into two individual parts: The Counter Mode (CTR) and The Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC).
CTR is used to encrypt the plaintext to ciphertext, and GMAC is used to generate the data tag. 
The algorithm flow chart of decryption part of GCM mode is shown as follow:

.. image:: /images/GCM_decryption.png

   :align: center

The decryption part is very similar with the encryption part of GCM mode.
The only difference is that we decrypt the ciphertext to plaintext in the decryption part.
In decryption part of GCM mode, we don’t provide a FAIL flag to indicate whether the data is authentic or not.
You should compare the tag which the decryption part gives with the tag from GCM encryption part to judge the authenticity of the data.
If the data is authentic, then the tags should be equal.

In our implementation, the encryption part of GCM mode has three modules, which are ciphertext_gen, dup_strm, and tag_gen.
As the three modules can work independently, they are designed into parallel dataflow processes, and connected by streams (FIFO's).
Thus, the AES_GCM_encryption which is the wrapper of the three modules, can achieve an initiation interval (II) = 1.
The decryption part can be deduced in the same way, so its II = 1.
