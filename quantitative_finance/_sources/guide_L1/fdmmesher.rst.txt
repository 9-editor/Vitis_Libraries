Meshers 
*******************

Overview
=========
The conception of mesher is used in the fd(finite-difference) method. Each mesher stores the discretization of one dimension. It has a array :math:`locations` that stores the discretization at points :math:`x_{0},x_{1},..,x_{n-1}`. It also has two othre arrays :math:`dplus` and :math:`dminus` that store the `i-th` elements :math:`(x_{i+1}-x_{i})` and :math:`(x_{i}-x_{i-1})` respectively.     

The multi-dimensional mesh for a finite-difference model is represented by multi 1-D meshers, which build the the full mesh by composing a 1-D mesh for every dimension of the problem.

Implementation
===================
Mesher creates an equally-spaced grid between two given boundaries and with the given number of points with a specific processor. 
1. locations: The coordinates of location are evolved based a normal random number.
2. dplus: The argument is calculated at point :math:`(x_{i+1}-x_{i})`.
3. dminus: The argument is calculated at point :math:`(x_{i}-x_{i-1})`.
